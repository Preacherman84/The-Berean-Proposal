<span style="font-family:georgia;font-size:18px;"><b><i>Principles Of The Proposal</i></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1). A Return To God's Word Can Bring The Return Of True Christianity.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Many people, including Christians, feel as though they have been hurt by churches and other Christians. This reality conveludes the difference between Christian abuse and true Christianity. Christian abuse takes place when Christians attempt to use God's Word as a weapon and not an instrument of love and forgiveness.  This wreaks havoc upon both non-Christians and Christians alike. On the other had, Christianity founded and ingrained in the teachings of Jesus Christ has never hurt anyone. Sure, there are some teachings that might be tough to accept, but true Christianity is grounded in the roots of love. We see this attitude exhibited when Peter instructed Christians in 1 Peter 3:15:
<i>
"but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect."
</i>
Consider a thought: What if Christians resolved themselves to make a return to God's Word, and God's Word only? Do away with man-made creeds and traditions and allow the powerful message of God's Word to shape our theology and lives? The primary purpose of the Berean Proposal is to encourage people to make a return to God's Word and God's Word alone. By providing relevant and engaging study material, our hope is you will allow God's Word to shape your theology and your life. Sure, there are numerous problems in the Church. But by making a return to God's Word we can come together around the common truth of God's Word.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2). Restoration Is More Than Patterns, But Restoring A Heart Of Discipleship.</strong></p>
In our attempt to restore Christianity to it's true form, there have been many great advancements.  When we study the New Testament, we can see how early Christians handled worship, church leadership, and other Biblical patterns.  All of these attributes are important, however simply restoring the patterns of Christianity does not restore Christianity to it's purest form.

In Romans 8:28 - 29 the Bible says:
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>"(28) And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. (29) For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."</em></p>
In this passage the Bible teaches us we have been saved to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.  How does this relate to the Biblical restoration of Christianity?  The question to be asked is not, "Do we mirror the New Testament Church?"  The question to ask ourselves is "Do we mirror the life and ministry of Jesus Christ?"  Think of it this way.   In 1 Corinthians 11:1 Paul wrote, "<em>Imitate me as I immediate Christ". </em> Who was Paul's example?  His example was Jesus Christ.  One might say, "But what about all these other issues in the Church?"  The reality is if we are striving to mirror the life and ministry of Jesus all these issues take care of themselves.  The question of baptism's essentiality doesn't require a second thought.  Why?  Because Jesus said to do it.  The issue of division within the Church is resolved.  Why? Because Jesus prayed for unity of His believers, thus we do not divide over non-salvational issues.

When we restore both the patterns and heart of Christianity, we remove the chains of man-made doctrine and tradition.  We not only live the life of a Christian, but we do so with the heard of a disciple.

<strong>3). If One Seeks God's Truth, They Will Find God's Truth.</strong>

Jesus said in Matthew 7:7 - 8,
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"(7) Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. (8) For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened."</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In this passage Jesus says if we will seek after God we will find Him.  The primary ideal of The Berean Proposal is this very idea.  If we seek after God, His Truth, and His Will, we will find it.  In today's world so many people are searching for truth.  They're searching for something to fill the void left in a life without God.  The reality is God has put this void in our lives so that we will seek to fill it with His purpose and His love in our lives.  As Paul said in Acts 17:26 - 28,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>"(26) And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, (27) that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, (28) for "'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, "'For we are indeed his offspring.'"</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">All we see around us, the trees, nature, and weather were made to show us the awesomeness of God.  All of this was created so we would seek to fill the void in our lives with His purpose and love.</p>
